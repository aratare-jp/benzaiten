# Rationale

Like a lot of people, I've been searching for a good todo list app since I understood how well-organised tasks can make me work better. During this time, I've come across quite a few number of great apps, including [TickTick](https://ticktick.com). TickTick comes with a plethora of features on top of your everyday's basic todo stuff, such as:

- Smart lists: Aggregate and customise how you want to view your lists
- Tags: Tagging tasks based on what they are
- Calendar: View what tasks you have in a bird-eye view
- Pomodoro timer: Work in short bursts of 25-mins sessions to increase efficiency and focusability
- Other views: Kanban, sorting, filtering, etc.
- And more

Overall, it's a great app. Unfortunately, it does lack several features that, ironically, I have come to crave for because of TickTick's own great features:

- Kanban view only works in normal lists. So you can't, say, use it for smart lists or other things.
- Kanban view is just a view with a bunch of columns. There is no automation to design how tasks should be moved around.
- There is no way to abandon a task aside from deleting it. However, with repeative tasks, deletion is obviously not desirable.
- Some other little things like texts are too small...

As such, Benzaiten is designed to address these things, and being absolutely free at the same time. For more about features that I'm planning for Benzaiten to have, check out [here](#features).
